# Blog Post Directory

*This directory stores the source files for blog posts.*

## Overview
This directory, `posts`, contains the source files for all blog posts.  Each post is stored as a separate file (see Contents).  The `.keep` file prevents accidental deletion of this directory.  The naming convention for post files is straightforward and allows for easy sorting and management.  No special software is required to view or edit the contents of these files.

## Contents
* `\.keep` â€” Empty file to prevent accidental directory deletion.


## Conventions
Each post file is named using a descriptive title, suitable for both filenames and display.  Future versions might include metadata within the files themselves.
