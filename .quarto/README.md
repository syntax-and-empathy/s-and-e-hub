# Quarto Project Site

*A collection of Quarto-based web content.*

## Overview
This directory houses the source files for a website built using Quarto.  The site features articles, resources, and experiments related to Syntax & Empathy.  The content is organized using Quarto's project-based workflow, with markdown files compiled into HTML output.  The `idx` directory contains the index file and metadata. The `project-cache` directory stores intermediate compilation files.


## Contents
* `idx/about.qmd.json` — Metadata and Markdown for the "About" page.
* `idx/index.qmd.json` — Metadata and Markdown for the website's index/home page.
* `project-cache/deno-kv-file` — Cached compilation data.


## Conventions
The site uses a Quarto project structure, with JSON files storing metadata associated with each markdown document.
