# idx: A Quarto Website

*A collection of Quarto documents for a website.*

## Overview
This directory (`idx`) contains the source files for a website built using Quarto.  It includes the main index page and an 'about' page.  The site aggregates long-form posts, resources, and experiments.  The content is managed using Quarto's `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) format.  To build the website, you'll need to have Quarto installed.


## Contents
* `about.qmd.json` — Metadata for the "About" page.
* `index.qmd.json` — Metadata for the main index page.

## Quick Start
To build the website, navigate to this directory and run `quarto render`.

## Conventions
The site uses a standard Quarto project structure.  Each page is represented by a `.qmd` file containing both content and metadata.
