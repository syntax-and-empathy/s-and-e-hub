# Project Cache

*A directory for managing project-specific cached data.*

## Overview
This directory, `project-cache`, stores persistent data for the main project.  It uses a structured approach to manage cached information, improving application performance by reducing redundant computations. The cache is designed to be self-contained and easily managed.  Currently, it uses a single SQLite database.  Data is written and read by dedicated scripts within the main application.

## Contents
* `deno-kv-file` â€”  SQLite database storing key-value pairs.


## Conventions
The cache uses a single SQLite database to store all cached data.  Future expansion may include additional storage mechanisms, but the present structure is intended to remain simple and maintainable.
