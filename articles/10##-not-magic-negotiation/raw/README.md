# raw data and scripts for article generation

*A collection of raw materials and scripts used in the article creation process.*

## Overview
This directory contains the raw materials and initial drafts for an article generation project.  It includes a detailed brief outlining the article's objective and process, as well as a rough draft of the article itself. The files are in Markdown format for easy editing and collaboration. This repository serves as a central hub for managing the article's development from initial concept to final publication.  The scripts (if any) would automate parts of this process.

## Contents
* `00-brief.md` — Article creation guide with detailed instructions and objectives.
* `00-rough.md` — Initial rough draft of the article.


## Conventions
Files are named using a descriptive naming convention.  The numbering scheme (e.g., `00-`) helps with logical ordering of the files related to the article creation.
