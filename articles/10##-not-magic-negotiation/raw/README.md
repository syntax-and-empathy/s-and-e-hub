# raw data and processing scripts

*A collection of raw data files and scripts used for data processing.*

## Overview
This directory contains the raw data files and associated processing scripts for a data analysis project.  The `00-brief.md` file provides guidance on article creation, while `00-rough.md` contains a detailed report on a Colab-based NLP research system.  The scripts (if any) are designed to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.  This structure facilitates reproducibility and transparency in the research workflow. The files are primarily in markdown format for easy readability and editing.

## Contents

* `00-rough.md` — Comprehensive report on a Colab-based NLP research system, detailing its development and challenges.


## Conventions
