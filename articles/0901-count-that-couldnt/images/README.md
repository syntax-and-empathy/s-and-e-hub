# Image Folder Analysis: Metadata & Excerpts

*This README provides metadata and excerpts from files within the 'images' directory.*

**Overview**

This directory contains a collection of image files and associated metadata.  The metadata includes file sizes and short text excerpts for some files. Note that a macOS `.DS_Store` file is present.  This README summarizes the directory's contents based on available metadata; further analysis is needed for a complete understanding of the image files themselves.  The included `meta.yml` file provides a more detailed analysis summary.

**Contents**

* `meta.yml`: YAML file summarizing the directory's contents and metadata analysis.
* `.DS_Store`: macOS system file containing metadata about the directory's appearance.
* `a-v-h-1.png`: Image file (contents not readily available).
* `ai-failure-vague-prompts-banner.png`: Image file (contents not readily available).
* `ai-failure-vague-prompts-social.png`: Image file (contents not readily available).


**Structure**

The directory contains image files, primarily `.png` format.  File naming suggests potential association with AI-related projects and vague prompts.
