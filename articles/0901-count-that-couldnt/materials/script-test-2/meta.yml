synopsis: This project uses a Python script to analyze four versions of an article
  (draft, refined, edited, final) to quantify the impact of each revision stage.  The
  analysis includes metrics such as word retention, sequence similarity, and pairwise
  cosine similarity using TF-IDF.  The results offer insights into the evolution of
  the article's content and structure throughout the writing process.
