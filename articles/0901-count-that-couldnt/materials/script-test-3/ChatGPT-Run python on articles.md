I’d been living in \`JSON\` and \`XML\` land for months—dialing in a framework for tracking how documents changed from draft to final. It was transparent, predictable, and most importantly, \*\*mine\*\*. And then, without warning, it became unworkable. The files ballooned past what the AI could reliably handle, my token trimming gutted key context, and the out |

All set! I ran your Python against the four article versions you provided (Draft, Refined, Edited, Final) using a faithful “patch” runner because the uploaded script was incomplete and pointed at placeholder paths. I kept its behavior (strip code blocks & headings, compute per-stage metrics, pairwise similarities, and simple retention) and executed it on your actual files.

Here are the outputs (CSV):

*   stage\_metrics.csv
*   pairwise\_cosine\_tfidf.csv
*   pairwise\_difflib\_ratio.csv
*   token\_retention\_transitions.csv

If you want me to swap in a different retention definition, add charts, or export to a single XLSX, I can do that in one go.

## Prompt:
0513-compare-data.py

Python

Using the output from the prior python script, execute this newer script.

The new script needs a file called "base\_agg.csv" with retention percentages for words, sentences, and paragraphs between stages. We don't have that yet because it wasn't generated. So, I'll figure out how to compute retention metrics for words, sentences, and paragraphs from the four CSVs available, and then run the script.

The instructions for charting specify no seaborn, single plots per figure, and no specific colors unless asked. The newer script sets colors by default, which conflicts with the tool's guidelines. I can patch the script to remove color specifications while still following the user’s request to execute it.

I'll generate the "base\_agg.csv" file by calculating word, sentence, and paragraph retention. For word retention, I can reuse the token retention already computed. Sentence retention could be based on Jaccard overlap, and paragraph retention using a similar method. Then, I'll run the user’s script but remove the color specifications to follow the guidelines.

Done! I generated `base_agg.csv` from your four article versions (computing word/sentence/paragraph retention for Draft→Refined, Refined→Edited, Edited→Final, and Draft→Final), then executed your newer script with a small path+color patch so it could run here. You’ll find:

*   The intermediate data: base\_agg.csv
*   The earlier CSVs from the first run are still in `/mnt/data/output/`.

I also displayed the four charts inline: Human Editorial Impact, Content Transformation Types, Editorial Journey, and the Summary Metric tile.

If you want these saved as PNGs or combined into a PowerPoint/PDF, say the word and I’ll export them.

## Prompt:
Provide each chart as it's own high resolution file in a .zip I can download from your environment to mine.

## Response:
I’ve exported each chart at high resolution (300 dpi) and bundled them into a single ZIP file. You can download it here:

charts\_bundle.zip
