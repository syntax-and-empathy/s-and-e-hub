# Charts Bundle

*A collection of charts visualizing editorial impact.*

## Overview
This directory contains image files used to illustrate key metrics and editorial processes.  The charts are designed for presentations and reports focusing on human impact.  They provide a visual summary of various aspects of editorial workflows and their effectiveness.  Currently, the charts are static PNG images; interactive versions may be added later.  No further action is needed to use these files; they are ready for inclusion in relevant documents.

## Contents
* `content_transformation.png` — Chart showing content transformation stages.
* `editorial_journey.png` — Chart illustrating the editorial journey.
* `human_editorial_impact.png` — Chart visualizing the human impact of editorial changes.
* `summary_metric.png` — Chart summarizing key editorial metrics.

## Conventions
All charts use a consistent style guide for clarity and visual appeal.  File names are descriptive and self-explanatory.
