title: Analyzing Article Revisions with Python
tagline: A quantitative analysis of article revisions using Python scripts and NLP
  techniques.
tldr:
- Measured character, word, and sentence counts across four article stages.
- Calculated pairwise similarity using TF-IDF and difflib.
- Analyzed token retention rates between revisions.

synopsis: This project quantitatively analyzes the evolution of an article through
  four distinct revision stages (Draft, Refined, Edited, Final).  Python scripts were
  used to calculate metrics such as word counts, sentence counts, and pairwise similarity
  scores (using TF-IDF and difflib) to understand the changes made during each revision.  Token
  retention rates provide insight into the overall consistency between versions.
