  \ changes in an article's evolution using Python and NLP.\ntldr:\n  - Analyzed word,\
  \ character, and sentence counts across four revisions.\n  - Computed pairwise similarity\
  \ using TF-IDF and difflib.\n  - Determined token retention rates to assess version\

  \ to quantitatively analyze the evolution of an article across four stages: Draft,\
  \ Refined, Edited, and Final.  Metrics like word counts, sentence counts, and pairwise\
  \ similarity (using TF-IDF and difflib) illustrate the changes made between revisions.\
  \ Token retention rates further reveal the consistency across versions.\ntags: Python,\
