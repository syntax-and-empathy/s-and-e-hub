title: AI-Powered Document Version Analysis
tagline: Quantifying the evolution of documents through automated metrics and visualizations.
tldr:
- Generated Python scripts using AI to compare multiple document versions.
- Calculated metrics like word retention, sentence similarity, and TF-IDF cosine similarity.
- Visualized the results to understand the impact of each editing stage.

synopsis: This project demonstrates the use of AI to automate the analysis of document
  revisions.  A Python script, largely generated with AI assistance, calculates various
  metrics (word retention, sentence and paragraph retention, and cosine similarity
  using TF-IDF) to quantify the changes between different versions of a document.
  The results provide insights into the editing process and the impact of each revision
  stage.  The analysis is complemented by visualizations (charts, not included in
  this data set).
