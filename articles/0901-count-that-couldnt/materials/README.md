# AI-Powered Document Version Analysis
*This directory contains the data and scripts used to analyze the evolution of documents using AI-generated Python code and metrics.*

**Overview**

This repository documents a project that quantifies changes between multiple versions of a document.  Using AI-generated Python scripts, several metrics (word retention, sentence similarity, and TF-IDF cosine similarity) were calculated.  The analysis provides insights into the evolution of the document's content and structure across different revision stages.  The core findings are documented in Markdown files, with supporting data and scripts also included.  This data set primarily focuses on the calculated metrics.  Visualizations are omitted from this particular data set.


**Contents**

* `0510-ai_script_reflection_full_with_appendix.md`:  Reflection on the AI script development process and challenges encountered.
* `0510-chatgpt-ai-script-debugging-analysis.md`: Detailed analysis of the AI script debugging process.
* `0510-generate-data.py`: Python script to generate the core analysis data.
* `0513-chatgpt-human-contribution-metrics-charts.md`: Documentation of human contribution metrics charts (charts themselves not included).
* `0513-compare-data.py`: Python script used to generate human contribution charts and analyses.
* `ChatGPT-Python File Analysis.md`:  Analysis of ChatGPT's work with the Python scripts.
* `meta.yml`: Metadata about the project, including title, tagline, and synopsis.
* `script-test-2/.DS_Store`: MacOS metadata file (can be safely ignored).
* `.meta.hash`: File hash for version control integrity checks.


**Conventions**

Markdown files use a consistent naming convention: `MMDD-description.md`. Python files are named descriptively based on their function.
