# Materials for Article Metrics Analysis

*This directory contains data and scripts used to analyze the evolution of an article across multiple revisions.*

## Overview
This directory stores materials related to a metrics analysis project focusing on tracking changes in an article across different versions (draft, refined, edited, and final).  It includes Python scripts for data generation and analysis, along with various data files (CSV, JSON) and markdown files documenting the process. The analysis focuses on metrics such as word count, sentence count, and similarity between versions.  Results are presented in CSV and visual charts (located in zipped folders).

## Contents
- `0510-ai_script_reflection_full_with_appendix.md` — Reflections on using AI to generate the Python scripts.
- `0510-chatgpt-ai-script-debugging-analysis.md` — Detailed log of debugging AI-generated scripts.
- `0510-generate-data.py` — Python script to extract basic metrics from article versions.
- `0513-chatgpt-human-contribution-metrics-charts.md` — Prompt engineering and chart specifications for human contribution analysis.
- `0513-compare-data.py` — Python script to generate charts from analysis data.
- `ChatGPT-Python File Analysis.md` — ChatGPT analysis of the Python file and its interaction with the input files.
- `script-test-1/`, `script-test-2/`, `script-test-3/` — Subdirectories containing results from different test runs of the scripts.  Each subdirectory contains csv files summarizing the results and zipped folders with resulting charts.


## Quick Start
The `0510-generate-data.py` script processes markdown files to extract metrics.  Ensure that file paths within the script are correctly updated to match the location of your input markdown files.  Then, run the script using a Python interpreter: `python 0510-generate-data.py`.  The output is a CSV file containing the metrics.

## Conventions
The project uses a consistent naming convention for files, incorporating dates and descriptive labels.  Results from different script executions are organized into separate subdirectories.  Charts generated by the Python scripts are bundled in zip files within each test subdirectory.
