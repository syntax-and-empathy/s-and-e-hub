# script-test-1

*A collection of scripts and data for analyzing article revisions.*

## Overview
This directory contains Python scripts and associated data used to analyze the evolution of an article through multiple revision stages.  The analysis includes metrics such as word count, sentence count, and pairwise similarity between revisions.  The results are presented in CSV files and visualized in charts (archived in `charts_export.zip`). The provided data represents a case study of a single article's journey through four stages: Draft, Refined, Edited, and Final.  This repository serves as a reproducible example for similar analyses.

## Contents
* `Article_Stage_Metrics.csv` — Key metrics (word counts, etc.) for each article stage.
* `ChatGPT-Python script execution results.md` — Detailed report of Python script execution and results, generated by ChatGPT.
* `Pairwise_Similarity__Cosine__bag-of-words_.csv` — Pairwise similarity scores between article revisions using cosine similarity and bag-of-words.
* `Successive_Stage_Word_Retention____.csv` — Percentage of words retained between successive article revisions.
* `base_agg.csv` — Aggregate metrics showing word and sentence retention across various stages.
* `charts_export.zip` — Archive containing visualizations of the analysis results (PNG images).


## Quick Start
To reproduce the analysis, you will need Python and the necessary libraries (likely including pandas and scikit-learn).  The `0510-generate-data.py` script (not included in this repo, referenced in `ChatGPT-Python script execution results.md`) was used to generate the data.  The analysis is primarily based on the CSV files provided, enabling reproduction even without the original script.


## Conventions
Data files use underscores to separate words in filenames (e.g., `Article_Stage_Metrics.csv`).  Results are primarily presented in CSV format for easy programmatic access and analysis.
