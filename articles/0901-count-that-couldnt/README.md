# The Count That Couldn't: A Cautionary Tale of AI-Assisted Writing

*A five-part series documenting the challenges of building a tool to track human contributions to AI-generated text.*

## Overview
This directory contains the markdown source files for a five-part blog post series. The series details the author's attempts to create a tool that measures the balance between human and AI contributions to written content.  The project started with simple JSON, but quickly evolved into more complex approaches, highlighting the challenges and lessons learned along the way. Each `.md` file represents a part of the series. The `meta.yml` file contains metadata for the entire series.

## Contents
- `01-the-count-that-coudnt.md` — Part 1: Early attempts at building a transparent testing tool.
- `02-the-count-that-coudnt.md` — Part 2: Shifting from JSON/XML to AI-generated Python.
- `03-the-count-that-coudnt.md` — Part 3:  Analyzing the project's failures and learning from them.
- `04-the-count-that-coudnt.md` — Part 4:  Finding a new, more successful approach.
- `05-the-count-that-coudnt.md` — Part 5 (missing):  Final thoughts and conclusions.
- `meta.yml` — Metadata for the blog post series.


## Conventions
Each part of the series is a separate markdown file (`*.md`).  The files are numbered sequentially.
