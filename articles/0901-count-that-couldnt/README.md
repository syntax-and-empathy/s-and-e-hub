# The Count That Couldn't: A Cautionary Tale of AI-Assisted Writing
_A chronicle of failed attempts to build an AI-powered writing tool, and the lessons learned._

**Overview**

This directory contains the source files for a five-part blog post series detailing the challenges of building a tool to track human contributions to AI-generated text.  The project started with simple JSON, but evolved into a more complex (and ultimately unsuccessful) Python-based system.  The articles detail the process, highlighting the unexpected complexities and providing valuable lessons for anyone working with AI for writing and data processing.  The series is intended to be instructive, showcasing failures as much as successes.

**Contents**

* `draft-article.md`: Initial draft of the first article in the series.
* `edited-article.md`:  A later edit of the first article.
* `final-article.md`: The final version of the first article.
* `meta.yml`: Metadata for the article series (title, description, tags, etc.).
* `.meta.hash`:  Content hash for the repository.
* `refined-article.md`:  A refined version of the first article, incorporating feedback.


**Conventions**

Markdown files (`*.md`) follow a consistent structure: title, TL;DR summary, main content, and concluding remarks. Metadata is stored in a YAML file (`meta.yml`).
