# Algorithmic Theatre: A Writer's Journey Through AI-Assisted Authorship

_A documented exploration of building tools to measure AI contribution in the writing process, highlighting both technical challenges and unexpected ethical considerations._

**Overview**

This repository contains the source materials and documentation for a series of articles exploring the creation of tools designed to analyze and track the interplay between human writers and AI during the writing process.  The project involved building both Python and browser-based tools, revealing significant technical and ethical challenges in achieving true transparency.  The articles document the iterative process, successes, and failures encountered along the way. The code and materials can be used to follow along with the experiments described in the articles.

* `02-refined-article.md`: Refined version of the article.
* `03-edited-article.md`:  Final edited version of the main article.
* `04-final-article.md`: Final version of the article (empty placeholder).
* `meta.yml`: Metadata for the project and articles.
* `materials/`: Directory containing supporting materials for the articles.
    * `0606-ai-writing-analyzer.py`: Python prototype for analyzing text changes.

**Conventions**

Article files (`*.md`) follow a numbered sequence reflecting the evolution of the article.  Material folders (`materials/` and `raw/`) organize supporting documents and code.  `meta.yml` files provide metadata for project overview and materials.
