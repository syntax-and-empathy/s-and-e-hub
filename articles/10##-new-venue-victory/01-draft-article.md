# Article 4 — Building a Reproducible Colab Pipeline for AI/Human Authorship Analysis

## Introduction

Efforts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into professional writing workflows often confront two persistent challenges: reproducibility and transparency. Early experiments to measure the balance of human and AI input in article creation repeatedly stalled on these very issues. The task was deceptively simple — track how an article evolves across multiple versions, from AI draft through human refinement to final publication — yet early attempts collapsed under inconsistent metrics, brittle scripts, and opaque processes.

The solution ultimately emerged in the form of a fully orchestrated, reproducible pipeline built in **Google Colab**. This article traces that journey, from fragile prototypes to a robust, publication-ready system. Along the way, it highlights the importance of ethical framing, transparency in AI-assisted authorship, and practical workflows for design and research professionals.

## From Scripts to Structure: Early Iterations

The first experiments in measuring AI versus human authorship relied on fragmented scripts and ad hoc testing. Python code generated in conversational interfaces frequently failed on execution, breaking on details like regex parsing, library imports, or folder detection. Attempts to stitch together GitHub-hosted scripts with manual file uploads “bombed horribly” “That one was a really bad failure”.

The initial notebook, **`ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb`**, marked a modest step forward. Instead of attempting full semantic analysis, it focused on simple counts — characters, words, and document-level similarity scores. This shift away from JSON-based attempts reduced complexity and established a baseline for computational metrics. Still, the method lacked structure and interpretability.

## Establishing a Pipeline: Modular Checkpoints

With **`ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb`**, the system took on a more recognizable pipeline form. Borrowing from the “generate” script’s successes, it introduced a cleaner analysis flow that automated comparisons between article versions. This modularity allowed iterative progress and reduced dependence on manual oversight.

The real architectural breakthrough came with **`ai-vs-human-v0.3.ipynb`**, where the process was formally divided into **reviewable checkpoints**. Each stage — Data Ingestion & Validation, Text Preprocessing, Similarity Analysis, Attribution Mapping, Metrics Generation, Visualization Prep, and Archive Export — became a discrete step. By saving structured checkpoint files, the pipeline could be paused, inspected, and resumed without repeating work. This design ensured transparency and allowed early error detection.

## The Colab Transition

The limitations of running fragmented scripts through chat interfaces made clear the need for a stable environment. The shift to **Google Colab** provided exactly that. Colab’s integration with Google Drive enabled reproducible orchestration, modular code execution, and accessible archival of results.

The **0614 transcripts** capture the turning point vividly:

* “It’s been like five different attempts…some got super close, some used questionable measures, but I’ve learned a lot along the way.”
* “We’ve had three real errors. But this is doing so much more than I actually got before. It’s loading the libraries with Python. It’s mounting my drive.”
* “Honestly, I’m amazed. I’ve probably spent no more than three hours.”

In Colab, the pipeline was able to run end-to-end, producing structured JSONs, attribution mappings, and even a full graphics package.

## A Collaborative Build Process

The Colab setup was guided by a clear specification: analysis should capture both **lexical and semantic changes**, attribute retained content to its original version, and export archival data optimized for future AI consumption.

Key non-negotiables included:

* **Colab/Drive orchestration** (free and reproducible).
* **Step-by-step processing** with checkpoint data for review.
* **Cost avoidance** (no external paid resources).

The build notes document a highly iterative, collaborative process between human guidance and model code generation. Errors were frequent, but each correction deepened the robustness of the system. One note reads: *“Holy expletive, it had me run a diagnostic rather than random updates for the next hour…Claude is updating the entire thing each time. There is a happy middle, but I’m not going to tempt fate here.”*

## What the Pipeline Delivers

The final **`ai-vs-human.ipynb`** pipeline outputs a complete analytical package:

* **Lexical and semantic similarity** across all article versions.
* **Attribution maps** showing how much content persisted from draft through final.
* **Metrics JSONs** (e.g., word progression, modification intensity, origin retention).
* **Visualizations** including flow charts, pie charts, heat maps, and interactive Sankey diagrams.

For example, one analysis of the “markup-languages” article reported that only **2.4% of draft sentences survived unchanged**, while **85.7% of the final content originated from human editing**. The remaining text was substantially modified or newly added.

## Ethics and Transparency as Design Constraints

Beyond technical achievement, the pipeline demonstrates how transparency can be built into workflows. By documenting each stage, quantifying change, and attributing authorship contributions, the system addresses:

* **Instruction & Intentionality Gap** — showing how AI drafts are transformed by human refinement.
* **AI Tax & Quality Deficit** — quantifying the scale of human effort needed to elevate AI outputs.
* **Ethical & Reliability Risk** — reducing opacity by making AI/human attribution auditable.

As the brief emphasized, treating bias, reliability, and exclusion as critical bugs requires tooling as rigorous as this pipeline.

## Conclusion

What began as a string of failed scripts and mounting frustration became, through persistence and systematic iteration, a **fully orchestrated, reproducible pipeline**. Built in Colab, it balances technical rigor with ethical intent, providing a transparent framework for evaluating AI-assisted authorship.

For professionals integrating AI into their workflows, the value lies not only in the metrics themselves but in the process: reproducible, reviewable, and ethically grounded. By making visible the transformation from draft to final, this pipeline contributes to a future where AI augments human creativity with accountability, not opacity.
