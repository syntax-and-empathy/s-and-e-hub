# raw Data and Processing Scripts

*This directory contains the raw data and scripts used for processing the data.*

## Overview
This directory houses the raw materials and associated processing scripts for a data analysis project.  It includes markdown files outlining the project brief and a rough draft of the analysis, along with supporting data files (not explicitly listed here for brevity). The scripts are designed to facilitate the transformation and analysis of this raw data into a publishable format. This README provides an overview of the directory's contents and a brief guide to using the included scripts.  Further documentation may be required depending on your specific use case.


## Contents
* `00-brief.md` — Detailed guide for article creation based on the provided data.
* `00-rough.md` — Rough draft and key talking points for an article summarizing the data analysis pipeline.


## Quick Start

No executable scripts are currently included in this directory.  Further processing will require additional scripts and software.  

## Conventions

The naming convention for markdown files begins with "00-" to denote key project documents.  Further files will be added as the project progresses.
