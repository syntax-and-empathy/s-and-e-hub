# Articles Directory

*A collection of articles and related files.*

## Overview
This directory contains articles written for various purposes.  Each article is stored as a separate Markdown file.  This structure allows for easy organization and version control of the articles.  The `.gitkeep` file ensures that an empty directory is tracked by Git.  The `.DS_Store` file is a macOS system file and can be safely ignored.

## Contents
* `.gitkeep` — Empty file to ensure Git tracks this directory.
* `.DS_Store` — macOS system file (can be ignored).


## Conventions
Articles are named using a descriptive title, converted to lowercase with hyphens replacing spaces.  There is no set style guide beyond using standard Markdown formatting.
