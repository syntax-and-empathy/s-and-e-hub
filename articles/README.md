# AI-Assisted Writing Analysis: Articles

*A collection of articles and supporting materials documenting the development of an AI authorship analysis pipeline.*

## Overview
This directory contains a series of articles detailing the challenges and eventual success in building a reproducible pipeline to analyze the contributions of AI and human authors in a writing workflow.  The project involved several iterations, shifting from simpler JSON-based approaches to a robust Python-based system implemented in Google Colab. The articles document this iterative process, highlighting technical hurdles, design decisions, and lessons learned. Supporting materials, including Colab notebooks and transcripts, are also included. This repository provides a case study of practical AI integration and the importance of reproducible research.  The articles are intended for developers, writers, and anyone interested in using AI tools effectively and ethically.

## Quick Start
The Colab notebooks (`ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb`, `ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb`) contain the core analysis pipeline.  To run them, you'll need a Google account and access to Google Colab.  The notebooks are designed to be self-contained, though familiarity with Python and basic data analysis concepts is beneficial.

## Conventions
Articles follow a consistent five-part structure: introduction, background, methods, results, and conclusion. Supporting materials are organized chronologically within subdirectories.
