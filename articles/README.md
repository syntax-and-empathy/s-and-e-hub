# Articles: AI-Assisted Writing Experiments

*A collection of articles documenting the challenges and successes of building an AI-assisted writing tool.*

## Overview
This directory contains a series of articles detailing the development of a tool to track human and AI contributions to written content.  The project involved several iterations, starting with simpler approaches and culminating in a robust, reproducible pipeline built using Google Colab. The articles chronicle the challenges encountered, lessons learned, and the eventual success in creating a transparent and ethical workflow for AI-assisted writing.  The associated materials include Jupyter notebooks and transcripts of development sessions.

- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/0614-transcript-3.md` — Transcript of a development session.
- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/Claude-Python NLP Research in Colab.md` — Detailed notes on using Claude and Python for NLP research in Colab.
- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb` — Initial Jupyter Notebook for AI/human authorship analysis.
- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb` — Second Jupyter Notebook for AI/human authorship analysis.


## Quick Start
The Jupyter notebooks (`ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb`, `ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb`)  in the `09##-new-venue-victory/materials` subdirectory contain the core code for the AI/human authorship analysis pipeline.  They require a Google Colab environment to run.


## Conventions
Articles follow a consistent naming convention (`DD##-article-title/version.md`) within the `09##-new-venue-victory` subdirectory. Materials related to the development process are stored in the `materials` subdirectory.
