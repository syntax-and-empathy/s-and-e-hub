# Articles: AI-Assisted Writing Experiments

*A collection of articles documenting the challenges and triumphs of building an AI-assisted writing tool.*

## Overview
This directory contains a series of articles detailing the process of creating a tool to measure human contributions to AI-generated text.  The project initially struggled with scaling and reproducibility issues, but ultimately found success using a Google Colab pipeline. The articles chronicle the journey, highlighting lessons learned and showcasing the final, successful implementation.  The included materials provide context, code examples, and intermediate results. The `.meta.hash` file contains a hash of the directory's contents for version control.

- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/0614-transcript-3.md` — Additional transcript from June 14th.
- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/Claude-Python NLP Research in Colab.md` —  Detailed Colab notebook documentation.
- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb` — Initial Colab notebook.
- `09##-new-venue-victory/materials/ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb` — Second version of the Colab notebook.


## Quick Start
The core functionality is implemented in the Jupyter notebooks (`ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb`, `ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb`) within the `09##-new-venue-victory/materials` subdirectory. These notebooks leverage Google Colab for reproducibility.  Refer to the `Claude-Python NLP Research in Colab.md` file for detailed instructions.

## Conventions
Articles are organized chronologically within the `09##-new-venue-victory` subdirectory.  Supporting materials, including transcripts and Jupyter notebooks, are located in the nested `materials` subdirectory.
