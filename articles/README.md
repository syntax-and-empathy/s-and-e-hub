# Articles: Measuring Human Contribution in AI-Assisted Writing

*A collection of articles and supporting materials exploring the challenges and insights of quantifying human contributions to AI-generated text.*

## Overview

This directory contains a series of articles detailing the iterative process of building a tool to measure the human contribution in AI-assisted writing.  The project involved several failed attempts, each documented to highlight the complexities and unexpected challenges encountered.  The accompanying materials include Python scripts, data files, and analysis documents generated during the development process. This repository serves as a case study, illustrating the practical difficulties in creating objective metrics for assessing AI collaboration in writing.  The insights gained offer valuable lessons for those undertaking similar projects.

## Contents

* `0901-count-that-couldnt/01-the-count-that-coudnt.md` — The first article in a series documenting attempts to build an AI-assisted writing metrics tool.
* `0901-count-that-couldnt/materials/0510-generate-data.py` — Python script for basic text analysis.
* `0901-count-that-couldnt/materials/script-test-2/base_agg.csv` — Aggregated data from script test 2.
* `0901-count-that-couldnt/materials/script-test-2/charts_bundle.zip` — Charts generated from script test 2 data (Note: large file omitted from this README).
* `0901-count-that-couldnt/materials/script-test-3/Article_file_basic_counts.csv` — Basic counts of articles from script test 3.


## Quick Start

The Python scripts require adjustments to file paths to function correctly.  Refer to individual script READMEs or comments within the code for specific usage instructions.  Data analysis is primarily performed using Python's pandas and related libraries. Results are presented in CSV and Markdown files.


## Conventions

The articles follow a consistent structure, beginning with a concise overview and concluding with a summary of findings.  Supporting materials are organized chronologically and by script test.
