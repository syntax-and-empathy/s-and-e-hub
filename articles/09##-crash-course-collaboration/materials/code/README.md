# AI Writing Analyzer Results

*Analysis of article revisions using a custom Python script.*

## Overview
This directory contains the code, input files, and output reports for an analysis of different versions of a "Markup Languages" article.  The Python script `0610-ai-writing-analyzer-enhanced.py` compares four stages of the article (Draft, Refined, Edited, Final) based on metrics like character count, word count, and average sentence length. The output includes detailed tables and reports summarizing these metrics and the transitions between stages. The analysis reveals changes in vocabulary and writing style across revisions. This data can inform future writing and editing processes.

## Contents
* `0610-ai-writing-analyzer-enhanced.py` — Python script for analyzing text files and calculating writing metrics.
* `output/ChatGPT-Article version analysis.md` — ChatGPT report summarizing the analysis.
* `output/markup-languages-analysis-report.md` — Markdown report summarizing key findings.
* `output/markup-languages-stage-metrics.csv` — CSV file with stage-wise metrics.
* `output/markup-languages-transition-analysis.csv` — CSV file detailing transitions between stages.

## Quick Start
The analysis was performed by running the Python script `0610-ai-writing-analyzer-enhanced.py`.  The script processes the specified input files and generates the output reports found in the `output` directory.  No further action is required; the results are self-contained within this directory.

## Conventions
The output files use a consistent naming scheme and are formatted as Markdown (.md) and CSV (.csv) for easy readability and data processing.  The analysis focuses on quantitative metrics, providing objective measures of changes across the different article versions.
