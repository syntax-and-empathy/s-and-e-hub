I've been working on pulling a series of articles together for Substack, with the intent that I would first publish the index as a teaser. But then I saw the following in a newsletter I received:

Your Failed ChatGPT Projects Were Actually Training

Remember that time you spent three hours trying to get ChatGPT to format data correctly? Or when your "simple" Zapier automation turned into a debugging nightmare? Congratulations. You were doing AI Workflow Triage, identifying which tasks are actually worth automating.

Here's what companies are discovering: The best AI Automation Engineers aren't the ones who never fail. They're the ones who've failed so many times they can spot a doomed project in minutes. When Tabitha Jordan used Zapier AI to boost webinar attendance by 440%, she didn't start with the complex solution. She started by mapping every point where her old system broke.

Your graveyard of abandoned projects taught you something priceless: which problems AI can actually solve versus which ones just sound impressive in meetings.

“Lots of teams see Al's potential but get stuck turning ideas into action. Al Automation Engineers close that gap. They rapidly prototype and ship practical solutions using simple tools. By embedding directly within teams, these 'engineers' make sure every automation fits seamlessly into daily workflows and drives real results.”

When I read this it was like I was struck by lightening. I don't think I ever would have found these words, but this is the essence of the series. You do the work, you pay the tax, you question if you're getting the right results...if you're smart you do your due diligence. When I started what these articles cover I thought word counts were enough. I've learned so much on a topic I never would have considered, and I've learned how to benefit from so many other tools I never would have explored. I paid the tax a few times over, but I got an education, I learned new skills, and I have what I wanted...but so much better than I could have imagined then.

Write this article for me, people need to understand that busting ass is more than a tax, it's life experience, it's learning, it's growing.
