# Exporting Charts: A Comprehensive Guide

*Master the art of chart exporting for print and digital media.*

**Overview**

This repository contains a collection of charts related to data visualization and editorial processes.  The charts are primarily PNG images, suitable for inclusion in reports, presentations, or other documents.  The `meta.yml` file provides metadata about the collection, including a synopsis and relevant tags.  Note that some larger chart files have been temporarily skipped for efficient repository management.  The `.meta.hash` file contains a SHA256 hash for integrity verification.
