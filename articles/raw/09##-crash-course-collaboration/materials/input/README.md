# AI Writing Analysis Results: June 10, 2025

*Analysis of draft stages for a document, showing metrics and topic distributions.*

## Overview
This directory contains the results of an AI-powered analysis of multiple draft stages of a document.  The analysis compared four versions (draft, refined, edited, final) using a custom Python script (`ai-writing-analyzer.py`). The output includes metrics on word count, sentence length, vocabulary changes, semantic similarity between stages, and topic distributions across different stages. This data can be used to understand the writing process and identify areas for improvement.  The data is presented in CSV format for easy import into spreadsheet software or data analysis tools.

## Contents
* `0610-chatgpt-ai-writing-analyzer-help.md` — ChatGPT conversation detailing the analysis process and script usage.
* `0610-semantic_similarity_between_stages.csv` — Cosine similarity scores between consecutive draft stages.
* `0610-stage_metrics.csv` — Metrics for each stage (character count, word count, average sentence length).
* `0610-topic_distributions_by_stage.csv` — Topic distribution for each stage, showing shifts in focus.
* `0610-transition_analysis.csv` — Summary of changes between stages (similarity, word change, new vocabulary).


## Quick Start
The CSV files can be opened directly in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc for viewing and analysis.  Further analysis can be performed using statistical software or data visualization tools.

## Conventions
All files use the date "0610" (June 10th) as a prefix for easy identification of the analysis run.  CSV files use consistent naming conventions reflecting the type of data contained within.
