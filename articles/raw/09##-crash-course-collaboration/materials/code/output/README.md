# Markup Language Article Analysis

*A collection of reports and data analyzing revisions of a Markup Languages article.*

## Overview
This directory contains the results of an analysis comparing four versions (Draft, Refined, Edited, Final) of an article about markup languages.  The analysis includes metrics on character count, word count, average sentence length, and the semantic similarity between revisions.  Data is presented in Markdown reports and CSV files suitable for further analysis or visualization. This data can be used to understand the evolution of the article and identify areas for improvement in writing and editing processes. The analysis was performed using a custom Python script (not included).

## Contents
- `ChatGPT-Article version analysis.md` — Detailed report of the analysis generated by ChatGPT, including prompts and responses.
- `markup-languages-analysis-report.md` — Summary report of key findings, including stage metrics and transition analysis.
- `markup-languages-stage-metrics.csv` — CSV file containing stage-wise metrics (character count, word count, average sentence length).
- `markup-languages-transition-analysis.csv` — CSV file showing transition analysis between article versions (similarity metrics and vocabulary changes).


## Conventions
All CSV files use commas as delimiters and have a header row. Markdown files use standard Markdown formatting.
