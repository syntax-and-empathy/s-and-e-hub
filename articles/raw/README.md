# Reproducible AI/Human Authorship Analysis Pipeline

*A documented journey from fragmented scripts to a robust Google Colab pipeline for analyzing AI and human contributions in writing.*

## Overview
This directory contains the artifacts from a project aimed at creating a reproducible pipeline for analyzing the interplay between AI and human contributions in writing.  The initial attempts, documented in `meta.yml`, highlight the challenges encountered using various methods before settling on a Google Colab-based solution.  The subsequent files showcase the evolution of a single article through different revisions, along with the scripts and notebooks used for analysis. This repository serves as a case study in building robust and reproducible research pipelines for AI-assisted writing.  The primary focus is on transparency and ethical considerations within AI-assisted authorship.

## Contents
- `meta.yml` — Metadata describing the project, its challenges, and lessons learned.
- `10##-new-venue-victory/01-draft-article.md` — First draft of the article "Building a Reproducible Colab Pipeline for AI/Human Authorship Analysis".
- `10##-new-venue-victory/02-refined-article.md` — Second revision of the article.
- `10##-new-venue-victory/03-edited-article.md` — Third revision of the article.
- `10##-new-venue-victory/04-final-article.md` — Final version of the article.
- `10##-new-venue-victory/materials/*` — Supporting materials including transcripts, Colab notebooks, and analysis results.


## Quick Start
The analysis pipeline is primarily implemented in the Jupyter Notebooks located in the `10##-new-venue-victory/materials` directory. These notebooks require a Google Colab environment and access to the article versions.  The `ai-vs-human.ipynb` notebook represents the most complete and refined version of the analysis pipeline.


## Conventions
The project uses a version-controlled approach to track the evolution of the article and the analysis pipeline.  The `materials` subdirectory contains intermediate and final analysis outputs as JSON files and Jupyter Notebooks.
