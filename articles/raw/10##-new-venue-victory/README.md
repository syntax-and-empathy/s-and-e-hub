# 10##-new-venue-victory: Reproducible Colab Pipeline for Authorship Analysis

*A documented workflow for analyzing human-AI collaboration in writing, using Google Colab.*

## Overview
This directory contains the final project files for building a reproducible Google Colab pipeline to analyze the interplay between human and AI contributions in article creation.  The pipeline processes multiple article versions (draft, refined, edited, final),  calculating similarity metrics and visualizing the evolution of content. The project includes Jupyter Notebooks, data files, and markdown articles documenting the process and results.  This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the development, testing, and refinement of the pipeline.

## Contents
- `01-draft-article.md` — Initial draft of the article detailing the pipeline's development.
- `02-refined-article.md` — Refined version of the article incorporating feedback.
- `03-edited-article.md` — Edited version of the article following further review.
- `04-final-article.md` — Final version of the article ready for publication.
- `materials/0614-transcript-2.md` — Transcript of a development session.
- `materials/0614-transcript-3.md` — Additional transcript of a development session.
- `materials/Claude-Python NLP Research in Colab.md` — Notes from Claude AI on Python NLP research in Colab.
- `materials/ai-vs-human-v0.1.ipynb` — Initial Colab notebook version.
- `materials/ai-vs-human-v0.2.ipynb` — Second Colab notebook version.
- `materials/ai-vs-human-v0.3.ipynb` — Third Colab notebook version.
- `materials/ai-vs-human.ipynb` — Final Colab notebook.
- `materials/best-build-notes.md` — Summary of development progress.
- `materials/markup-languages_checkpoint_steps_1_2.json` — Checkpoint data.
- `materials/markup-languages_complete_analysis.json` — Complete analysis data.
- `materials/markup-languages_footer_metrics.json` — Footer metrics data.
- `raw/00-brief.md` — Initial project brief.


## Quick Start
The Colab notebooks (`materials/ai-vs-human.ipynb`) provide a complete, executable workflow.  Ensure Google Drive is mounted, then execute the cells sequentially.  The `materials` directory contains supporting data and intermediate results.

## Conventions
Jupyter Notebooks are versioned sequentially (v0.1, v0.2, etc.).  Data files follow a consistent naming convention indicating the article and analysis stage.
