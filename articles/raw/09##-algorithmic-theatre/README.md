# Rebuilding the Article Comparison Process: A Detailed Guide

*Improving article analysis with a new Python-based prototype and parallel manual tracking.*

## Overview
This directory contains the source files for an article documenting the development of a Python script and a browser-based tool for analyzing changes in articles across multiple writing stages.  The project aimed to create a reliable "compare" step, missing in earlier attempts, for evaluating the impact of AI assistance in writing. The core components are a Python script for computational analysis and an HTML/JavaScript application for manual tracking.  The approach combines automated metrics with human observations to ensure a transparent and accurate assessment of AI contribution. This repository includes article drafts, code, and supporting materials.
