synopsis: This guide details the development and implementation of a new Python script,
  '0606-ai-writing-analyzer.py', designed to analyze textual changes between different
  versions of an article.  It overcomes previous limitations by providing a computational
  analysis of content similarity and other key metrics across various stages of the
  writing process (Draft, Refined, Edited, Final).  Furthermore, the guide introduces
  a parallel manual tracking method to streamline and improve the overall efficiency
  of article analysis.
