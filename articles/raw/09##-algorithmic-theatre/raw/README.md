# Rebuilding the Article Comparison Process: Raw Materials

*A collection of raw materials used in the creation of a guide detailing improvements to article analysis, using a new Python script and parallel manual tracking.*

**Overview**

This directory contains the raw materials used to create a guide on improving the article comparison process.  It includes the initial brief, a rough draft, and metadata related to the article's development. These files serve as the source material for the final guide, documenting the process of rebuilding the "compare" step and introducing parallel manual tracking.  The files are primarily Markdown (.md) and YAML (.yml) for easy review and editing.

**Contents**

* `00-brief.md`:  The initial project brief outlining the objectives, process, and expectations for creating the guide.
* `00-rough.md`: A rough draft of the guide, containing initial thoughts and key talking points.
* `meta.yml`: Metadata file containing the article's title, tagline, synopsis, and other relevant information.
* `.meta.hash`:  A hash representing the current state of this raw materials directory.


**Conventions**

Files are named using a descriptive convention.  Markdown files use a `00-` prefix for primary documents followed by a more descriptive filename.  Metadata is stored separately in a YAML file for easy parsing.
