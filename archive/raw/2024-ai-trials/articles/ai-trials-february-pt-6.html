<p><u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v5.2### Preface</p>
<p>This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 6 of 8 posts for the month of <u>February</u>.</p>

<p>In a week of testing Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, the need for precise prompts has become evident, with specialized roles requiring detailed guidance for optimal outcomes. ChatGPT and Gemini excelled in content creation, while Claude was limited by generic inputs. Balancing evaluation methods is challenging; too much structure may deter average users, while heavy reliance on documentation could hinder non-technical accessibility. However, the observed incremental improvements suggest a future of seamless AI-human collaboration.</p>

<p>I’ve set up new sessions for each role, incorporating the latest roles, and intend to continue using the template without image requirements. For image creation, I’ll use a single GPT session with the visual role to avoid the complications encountered previously. Sounds straightforward, doesn’t it? Time to give Gemini a spin.</p>

<pre><code>Write the article for day seven. This is the information available to me: The seventh day is commonly referred as the "day of man", and in most parts of China people will eat noodles as they symbolize longevity in Chinese culture.</code></pre>
<p>To my surprise, Gemini produced an article seamlessly. Upon reviewing the three articles, it’s clear that Gemini’s output provides comprehensive details on par with GPT, while Claude, regrettably, seems to underperform. Despite my preference for Claude, the evidence points to Gemini being a significant competitor.</p>
<p>What’s even more astonishing is that the editors, across all three participating AIs, ranked Gemini’s article the highest, with ChatGPT in second place, and Claude in third. With this revelation, I’m inclined to shift my focus away from Claude for the time being and earnestly seek ways to refine my prompts. This approach aims to enhance AI’s creativity without overly constraining it with too-specific instructions.</p>

<p>I decided to give Claude a short break while I dedicate some time to learning about writing structured prompts for it. I had hoped to avoid diving into it so soon, but circumstances led me here. Since both ChatGPT and Gemini are theoretically capable of conducting research, I included a research requirement in the task to see if there would be any noticeable improvements.</p>

<p><strong>1. Accuracy and Factual Correctness: 4 (Very Good)</strong>The article provides an accurate portrayal of the Spring Festival’s eighth day, referencing traditional customs, agricultural practices, and the significance of these rituals in Chinese culture. The mention of Buddhist teachings and the importance of weather observations tie back to authoritative cultural and historical sources. However, without direct citations to specific texts or studies, minor inaccuracies may be undetected, hence not a perfect score.</p>
<p><strong>2. Depth of Historical Context: 4 (Very Good)</strong>The article offers a rich historical context, linking ancient practices to their cultural and agricultural roots, such as the connection between weather observations and agricultural outcomes, and the Buddhist origins of releasing captive animals. This depth enhances understanding of the traditions’ significance, although the exploration could further delve into the evolution of these practices over time for a comprehensive score.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words: 4 (Low Ratio of Filler)</strong>Content is predominantly informational, effectively communicating the customs and their meanings with minimal use of superfluous language. The article maintains a focus on delivering valuable insights into the Spring Festival’s practices, making efficient use of language to inform the reader.</p>
<p><strong>4. Clarity and Coherence: 5 (Excellent)</strong>The article excels in clarity and coherence, presenting ideas in a logical and organized manner.

<p><strong>5. Engagement and Readability: 4 (Very Good)</strong>With its vivid descriptions and cultural insights, the article is very engaging, capturing the reader’s interest through the exploration of traditions and their meanings. The use of a call to action in the conclusion further invites reader interaction, although slightly more varied techniques throughout could enhance engagement even more.</p>
<p><strong>6. Critical Analysis and Interpretation: 3 (Good)</strong>The article demonstrates a solid level of analysis, interpreting the significance of the Spring Festival’s customs within the broader context of Chinese culture and global observance. It considers the implications of these traditions on communal and ethical values. There’s room for deeper exploration of alternative perspectives or the impact of modernization on these practices for a higher score.</p>
<p><strong>7. Originality and Uniqueness: 3 (Moderately Original)</strong>While the article provides a fresh take on some aspects of the Spring Festival’s eighth day, especially in connecting ancient practices with contemporary values, it largely adheres to established narratives. The inclusion of global perspectives adds a unique dimension, but more innovative insights or less-explored facets of the festival could further distinguish it.</p>
<p>****Overall Assessment:****The article is a well-crafted piece that provides valuable insights into the Spring Festival’s eighth day, effectively blending historical context, cultural significance, and contemporary observance. It stands out for its clarity, coherence, and the engaging manner in which it presents traditional practices.

</ul>
<p><strong>Corrected Overall Rating Calculation:</strong></p>
<p>Average=4+4+4+5+4+3+37</p>
<p>Given the identical ratings for both articles, the calculation will yield the same result for Article 2 as for Article 1. Let’s proceed with these calculations to provide the correct overall ratings.</p>
<p>After recalculating the scores, both Article 1: “Daily Observance of the Spring Festival - Day 8: Blessings and Harvest Hopes” and Article 2: “Daily Observance of the Spring Festival - Day 8: Auspicious Skies and Flourishing Lives” receive an average rating of approximately <strong>3.86</strong> on a scale of 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Given the detailed rating criteria and the average scores calculated, both articles are rated <strong>Very Good</strong>. The identical scores reflect a consistent level of quality across various dimensions such as accuracy, depth of historical context, engagement, and clarity for both articles. The minor differences in thematic focus and specific content coverage between the two articles do not affect their overall rating, as both provide valuable insights into the Spring Festival’s eighth day with a high degree of coherence, engagement, and informational content.</p>
<p>The calculations are correct, but upon closer inspection, both articles received the same scores, which seems improbable. However, I remain unconvinced that they truly have identical scores.</p>

<pre><code>In a sentence, tell me the strength of each article so that I might pick the one I would want to publish.</code></pre>
<p>Article 1 excels in providing a comprehensive and engaging exploration of traditional customs and their significance within the broader context of the Spring Festival, while <strong><em>Article 2 stands out for its detailed focus on the Jade Emperor’s birthday</em></strong>, offering unique insights into the blend of Daoist beliefs and modern practices associated with this day.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gemini">Gemini</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, I only have access to the ratings and feedback for the second article “Daily Observance of the Spring Festival.” To accurately compare and contrast the two articles and provide an overall rating for each, I would need information about the first article “Day 8: Blessings and Harvest Hopes.” If you could share the relevant details about the first article, I would be happy to compare them both and provide a comprehensive answer.</p>
<p>However, based on the feedback provided for “Daily Observance of the Spring Festival,” it seems to be a well-rounded and informative article with a score of <strong>3.86 (Very Good)</strong>. It showcases strengths in structure, engagement, and cultural depth, but could benefit from including specific references and going deeper in its analysis.</p>
<p>Without information about the first article, it’s impossible to say definitively which one is better. However, the provided feedback can be used to guide further revision and improvement for both pieces.</p>
<p>ChatGPT encountered a few minor issues, most of which were not significant enough to document. On the other hand, Gemini proved to be less capable than it initially seemed.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>ChatGPT failed to provide the overall score for the first time, which was surprising since the prompts for the editor have been consistent for a few days now.</li>
<li>Gemini received a high score, even though it focused on the subject matter of the following day. This could be due to user error, and I will need to check the criteria next round.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gemini-better-but-bard-is-leaking-out">Gemini (better, but Bard is leaking out…)</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>While the eighth day is the eve of the Jade Emperor’s birthday, it’s unclear why it mentioned the subject of the ninth day at all. However, I won’t research it because of the Bard issue.</li>
<li>When asked to provide the ratings on the article it authored, it claimed to be unable to access the website it cited as a reference. Interestingly, it had 2 additional drafts, both of which succeeded.</li>
</ol>
<p><u></u>1. It failed to apply the criteria to GPT’s article until asked specifically to do so. This can be chalked up to user error if you like. After specifying it should do so, it seemed to have taxed its memory, so it forgot the ratings for its own article for the follow-up prompt.</p>
<p>“<u>Gemini</u>” is Latin for twins, which leads me to wonder if we got the less capable one today. The AI’s engagement with the eighth day revealed both strengths and inconsistencies. ChatGPT’s unexpected scoring and Gemini’s inability to focus on the requested subject matter, as well as later issues with applying the ratings, suggest that there is room for improvement in my own prompts and Gemini’s memory.</p>

<p>Refining the approach for these experiments led to a focused comparison of ChatGPT and Gemini’s writing capabilities by removing the distraction of image related tasks. This provided clearer observations into each AI’s ability to generate written content. This process further highlighted the need for adaptable approaches that could accurately evaluate the nuanced capabilities of AI tools, thereby underscoring the potential use in the workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Positive Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Removing image-related tasks simplified the comparison of writing styles, demonstrating improved writing capabilities despite Gemini veering off-topic.</li>

<ul>
<li>Precise prompts that cater to each AI is essential for effectively directing their responses; failure to do so has regularly led to undesirable results.</li>
<li>Despite clear objectives and the provision of supplementary data, Gemini deviated from the specified subject matter and effectively negated the value of an experiment.</li>
