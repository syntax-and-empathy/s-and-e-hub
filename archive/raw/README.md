# 2024 AI Holiday Content Generation Trials

*A year-long experiment tracking AI's content creation evolution.*

## Overview
This directory contains the data and analyses from a year-long experiment using various AI models (Bard, Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, LLaMA) to generate content about global holiday traditions.  The project meticulously documents prompts, challenges, model performance, and iterative improvements.  The findings offer insights into AI's evolving content creation capabilities and the limitations of current models.  Data is organized by quarter and includes individual articles exploring different methodologies and model comparisons.  The `meta.yml` file provides a high-level summary.

## Contents
* `2024-ai-trials/meta.yml` — Project metadata and summary.
* `2024-ai-trials/holiday-article-index.md` — Index of all articles.
* `2024-ai-trials/index-varied-formats.md` — Index in varied formats (JSON, Markdown).
* `2024-ai-trials/by-quarter/` — Quarterly reports on AI model performance.
* `2024-ai-trials/articles/` — Individual articles generated by AI models.


## Quick Start
To review the overall project summary, open and read `2024-ai-trials/meta.yml`. For a detailed chronological overview of the trials, start with the files within the `2024-ai-trials/by-quarter/` directory. Individual articles exploring specific holiday topics and model comparisons are located in the `2024-ai-trials/articles/` directory.

## Conventions
The project uses a consistent naming scheme for files, organized by year, quarter, and then individual articles. Metadata files (`.yml`, `.hash`) provide summaries and checksums for data integrity.  Articles typically follow a consistent structure with a preface, TL;DR summary, and detailed experiment description.
