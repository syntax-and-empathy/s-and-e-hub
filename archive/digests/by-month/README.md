# AI Content Creation Trials: By Month

*A collection of monthly reports detailing experiments in AI-generated content about global holiday traditions.*

**Overview**

This directory contains monthly progress reports documenting a year-long experiment using AI to create content about various holiday traditions worldwide. Each Markdown file details the methods, results, and observations of experiments conducted during a specific month.  The reports analyze the performance of different AI models under varying prompting techniques and explore the impact of factors such as prompt complexity, specified roles, and tone on the quality of the generated content.  This repository is intended to be read chronologically.

**Structure**

Each monthly report follows a consistent structure: Preface, Summary (TL;DR), Experimental Elements (AI Models, Holidays, Goals), detailed description of the experiment, and conclusions.

**Conventions**

All monthly reports are in Markdown format (`*.md`).  The filenames are consistently formatted as `ai-trials-{month}.md`.
