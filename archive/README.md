# AI Content Generation Trials Archive

*This directory contains a collection of Markdown files documenting a year-long experiment in using AI to generate content about global holiday traditions.*

**Overview**

This archive stores the results of a year-long project exploring the capabilities of various AI models in creating informative and engaging content about diverse cultural holidays.  The project involved iterative experimentation with different prompting techniques, AI models, and evaluation methods.  Each Markdown file represents a distinct phase of the experiment, detailing the methodologies, challenges, and outcomes.  The data can be used to analyze the evolution of AI content generation capabilities and the effectiveness of various prompting strategies. The files are organized chronologically by month and then by part within each month.

**Structure**

Each monthly section contains multiple `.md` files, each labeled as "Pt 1," "Pt 2," etc., representing parts of the monthly experiment.  Each file follows a consistent structure:  a preface describing the month's goals, a TL;DR summary, and detailed experiment results.
