# AI Content Generation Trials Archive

*This directory contains a year-long archive of experiments using AI to generate content about global holiday traditions.*

**Overview**

This repository archives the results of a year-long project exploring the capabilities of various AI models (Bard, Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT-4, and LLaMA) in creating content about holiday traditions worldwide.  The archive consists of markdown files documenting individual experiments, detailing prompts, AI responses, and analysis of results.  Each file represents a specific experiment or set of experiments conducted during a particular month.  The data provides insights into the evolution of AI content generation capabilities and the effectiveness of different prompting techniques.  Researchers can use this archive to understand the challenges and successes encountered in using AI for content creation.
