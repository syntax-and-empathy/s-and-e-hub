# 2024 AI Holiday Content Generation Trials

*A Year-Long Experiment Tracking AI's Content Creation Evolution*

## Overview
This directory contains the data and documentation for a year-long project exploring the capabilities of various AI models in generating content about global holiday traditions.  The experiment tracked model performance, iterative improvements, and challenges encountered throughout 2024.  The findings are documented in markdown files, organized by quarter.  This repository provides insights into the evolving capabilities of AI in content creation, particularly in the context of culturally sensitive topics. The data is analyzed through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings can be used to inform future research in AI-assisted content generation.
